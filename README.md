# e-games

During the 2nd year of college (2014) I was tasked to design and create an e-commerce site.

I decided the site should focus on selling computer games. Within the site, users can look at games available, create an account and then log in, submit their information in a form to place an _'order'_.

The shop was developed using HTML4, CSS3, PHP5, MySQL & JavaScript.
